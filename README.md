## 🔭 Who am I?

I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student who enjoys turning vague ideas into working backend features.  
Most of my learning comes from three loops: **build → break → fix**, writing code in Python/Django and PHP/Laravel.

---

## 🚀 What I actually built

Instead of a long skills list, here are a few things I’ve shipped:

### 🛒 E‑commerce Engine (Laravel + MySQL)
Backend for a small online store: auth, product catalog, cart, and order flow.  
I focused on: routing, controllers, DB design, and keeping the code readable for other devs.  
➡️ Repo: [famms-ecommerce](https://github.com/Rid-byte/famms-ecommerce)

### 💸 Expense Tracker (React – in progress)
I'm currently building a React-based expense tracker to practise component design, state management, and local storage.  
➡️ Repo: [Expense-Tracker](https://github.com/Rid-byte/Expense-Tracker)

### 🌐 Small Practice Projects
Smaller PHP / HTML / CSS projects and scripts in Python & C++ that I use to test ideas and practice problem solving.  
You can find them in my pinned repositories below.

## 🛠️ Tech I’m comfortable with

- **Languages:** Python, PHP, JavaScript, C/C++, SQL  
- **Development:** HTML, CSS, PHP (Laravel Framework), jQuery, Bootstrap  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Laravel (PHP), React JS, MySQL Connector  
- **Databases:** MySQL  
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, XAMPP, Google Cloud Platform (basic usage), VS Code  
- **Core CS:** Data Structures & Algorithms, Object‑Oriented Programming  

💡 I care less about listing every tool, more about being able to read code, debug it, and ship a fix.

## 🌱 How I practice

- Solve DSA problems regularly (arrays, strings, two pointers, basic DP) and rewrite slow solutions into cleaner ones.  
- Keep short notes on bugs I hit and how I fixed them—because I forget, and future‑me needs documentation.  
- Write blogs on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/).

---

## 📫 What I’m looking for

An internship where I can:

- Own small backend features end‑to‑end  
- Work with real users or internal teams  
- Get honest code reviews that make my next commit better  

If that sounds like your team, my inbox is open 🙂
